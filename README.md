This project, developed by a team of three, models a basic on-demand video streaming system that manages and retrieves information about movies and series, including user ratings.

The program is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, organizing video content into a class hierarchy that captures both shared and unique attributes and behaviors of different video types. Each video—whether a movie or a series—is stored with information such as title, duration, genre, and a list of ratings used to calculate an average score. In the case of series, the system also manages a collection of episodes, grouped by season.

The application provides core functionalities such as displaying all available content, listing episodes of a specific series, and filtering movies based on genre and average rating. It implements inheritance to reuse shared attributes, polymorphism for flexible content handling, method overriding and overloading to customize behaviors, and operator overloading to streamline comparisons and output formatting. Additionally, abstract classes are used to define a common interface for all types of videos, promoting extensibility.

This system serves as a solid foundation for more advanced digital content platforms, and showcases practical applications of key OOP concepts in C++.
